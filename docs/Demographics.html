<h2>Population</h2>
<p>The purpose of drawing conclusions from the NHTS is to provide better transportation–more accessible, safer, faster, etc.–by understanding the transportation patterns of the U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>This page will display the information found in the 2017 NHTS and compare the population of wheelchair users to the able-bodied population. <!-- This page also compares the disabled population (those who reported to have a medical condition for longer than six months) in addition to the population of wheelchair users. --></p>
<p>In this analysis I use the metric of distribution of relative population. For example <span class="math display">\[ wheelchairpercentage = \frac{counts}{wheelchairpopulation} \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ abledpercentage = \frac{counts}{abledpopulation} \]</span></p>
<div id="what-percent-of-the-respondants-use-a-wheelchair" class="section level3">
<h3>What percent of the respondants use a wheelchair?</h3>
<p>Of the U.S. population, it is reported that only ____ percent use wheelchairs. This is approximately ___ hundered americans.</p>

<h3>Population by Age</h3>
<p>Let’s look at how wheelchair users are distributed by age. This can be confusing as it looks like there are more wheelchair users than abled bodies at age 75, but remember it is distribution of wheelchair users to total wheelchair users.</p>
